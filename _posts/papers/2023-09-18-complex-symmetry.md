Testing the symmetries of quantum states and channels provides a way to assess their usefulness for different physical, computational, and communication tasks. Here, we establish several complexity-theoretic results that classify the difficulty of symmetry-testing problems involving a unitary representation of a group and a state or a channel that is being tested. In particular, we prove that various such symmetry-testing problems are complete for bounded-error quantum polynomial time, quantum Merlin–Arthur (QMA), quantum statistical zero-knowledge, two-message quantum interactive proofs (QIPs), two-message QIPs restricted to entanglement-breaking provers, and QIPs, thus spanning the prominent classes of the QIP hierarchy and forging a nontrivial connection between symmetry and quantum computational complexity. Finally, we prove the inclusion of two Hamiltonian symmetry-testing problems in QMA and quantum Arthur–Merlin, while leaving it as an intriguing open question to determine whether these problems are complete for these classes.
