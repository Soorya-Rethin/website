As part of my Masters degree at BITS, Pilani, I worked on a thesis project in my last semester. The project was a literature review on open quantum systems and quantum error correction. My thesis project was under Dr. Abhishek Mishra. The final thesis file can be found here ["Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Error Correction"][thesis].
